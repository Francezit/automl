# AutomatedML

AutomatedML is a modular framework for automated machine learning, supporting neural network architectures, model evaluation, optimization, and data handling.

## Features

- Modular component factory for ML pipelines
- Data container utilities
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Support for custom layers and models
- Extensible engine and utility modules

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd automl
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Configure Python Virtual Environment (Linux/macOS)

You can use the following shell commands to set up a virtual environment and install the package:

```sh
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
# Install the package
pip install -e .
```
